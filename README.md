ðŸ§  NSAP Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting eligibility for the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), a welfare scheme by the Government of India that provides financial support to the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities from below-poverty-line (BPL) households. Using machine learning algorithms, we aim to classify whether an individual is eligible for NSAP assistance based on various socio-economic features.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Built with Python and scikit-learn for model training.
Dataset sourced from AI-KOSH, focusing on social welfare eligibility.
Includes preprocessing, feature selection, model training & evaluation.
Deployed on IBM Cloud using Watson Studio.
User-friendly interface to input test data and view predictions.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

IBM Watson Studio
IBM Cloud Deployment
Jupyter Notebooks
Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

ðŸ“Š Model Output

The model takes user input data and predicts:
"Eligible" or "Not Eligible"
based on trained patterns from historical welfare application data.
