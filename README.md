📊 NSAP Eligibility Predictor using Machine Learning
This project aims to automate the process of determining eligibility for NSAP (National Social Assistance Program) welfare schemes in India. Leveraging machine learning and IBM Cloud deployment, the model classifies applicants into appropriate financial aid categories based on demographic and socio-economic data.

🚀 Project Overview
 -Objective: Predict eligibility for NSAP schemes using classification algorithms.

 -Dataset: AI_KOSH dataset provided by the Government of India.

 -Platform: Built and deployed using IBM Watson Studio & IBM Cloud.

 -Model Used: Snap SVM Classifier with AutoAI pipeline selection.

 -Accuracy: Achieved 62.2% accuracy on validation data.


🛠️ Technologies & Tools

-IBM Watson AutoAI: For model training and optimization

-IBM Watson Machine Learning: For deployment and real-time inference


📌 Features

✅ Predicts applicant eligibility for NSAP schemes

✅ Multi-class classification based on income and other features

✅ Automatically selects the best model pipeline

✅ Live deployment on IBM Cloud (API ready)
